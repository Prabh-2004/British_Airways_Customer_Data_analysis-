      "             |   I had an appalling experience with British Airways. It started when I tried to check in online but couldnï¿½t change my seat due to repeated website errors. I arrived at the airport 4 hours early to sort it out, but the staff at the check-in counter refused to help meï¿½brushing me off before I could even say which flight I was on, simply saying all flights were full. Incredibly rude and unprofessional. The BA lounge was overcrowded, uncomfortable, and poorly equippedï¿½wooden utensils only and very limited seating. Shortly before boarding, I was struck with excruciating abdominal pain. Fearing a medical emergency, I asked to be offloaded. Staff at the boarding gate took my boarding pass and luggage tag, asked me to wait, and then left me sitting there in agony for 40 minutes. I eventually asked to leave to go to hospitalï¿½staff said it was fine. However, in my distress, I didnï¿½t realise that they had taken my boarding pass with the baggage reference on it. I asked a group of wheelchair porters heading in my direction for help. None assisted me. I collapsed midway and was finally stretchered away by medics and taken to hospital. Thankfully, I received treatment and have now returned home. Since then, Iï¿½ve been trying to retrieve my luggage. Every number Iï¿½ve triedï¿½online, via the airport, and through customer serviceï¿½is either unreachable, goes to voicemail, or simply rings out. I have no idea where my bag is, and no one is helping. This is completely unacceptable from an international airline. British Airways has failed at every stage: technical support, in-person service, medical handling, and post-flight care.\n",

BA's T3 lounge is just not anything special, mediocre at best, food options lacking, its Gatwick &amp; T5 lounges are far more superior. On board usual poor seat pitch, the Club Europe product is inconsistent, no hot towels, menu given however food delivered on a trolley in the economy way, all the courses on one tray. No further bar offerings unless one used the call bell. Parked on remote stand at Krakow. On return Krakow - LHR Queued for twenty minutes at the Club Europe check in desk, the non-BA lounge was basic and at the late departure time of the flight, minimal food choices. On boarding Cramped into a bus and walked up on remote stand. No menus or hot towels, however meal orders taken individually and delivered direct from the Galley, seat uncomfortable, no wi-fi. Had to request tea after meal. Again inconsistency in service. The extra cost of Club Europe is hard to justify, there have been improvements in catering, however the product needs to be elevated to justify the cost.\n",

This was ok for me but sandwiches had run out from the in-flight cafe to the disappointment of passengers. Inflight wifi is limited and you have to pay to access music or programmes. BA's offering is well below that of Aegean and this level of service is not suitable for easterly destinations such as Larnaca. So I would certainly fly again with BA to Athens but only in the event Aegean has no seats or the fare is cheaper.\n",

      "             |   I really like flying British Airways particularly in their new Club World. The seats are great, have a privacy screen, comfortable enough for sleeping and BA crew are engaging and high spirited. Clearly, they must have been short of them because the business class meal service didnï¿½t even start until 2 hours into the flight. When I commented, I received a rather surly look. There was no apology just an off the cuff excuse about him being the only member of crew in this section of the cabin. This is not at all what I expect from BA particularly when you consider the price paid for the seat and the fact, they make you pay even more to just to choose where you sit. Come on BA ï¿½ surely you can do better than this?\n",

Lounge hosts were welcoming and friendly, food not quite up to par but much better onboard. The First Suite is spacious and comfortable, and the two cabin crew were both experienced, friendly, professional and personable. They sprang to action quickly after takeoff, making beds or serving dinner as required. The menu was excellent with a well cooked beef fillet and delicious salmon starter. The new Nyetimber 1086 is an exceptionally good wine! Overall the service was well relaxed and intuitive. The cabin was  comfortably cool and I left the flight feeling refreshed. BA have made some poor choices of late with their loyalty programme, but their staff still shine and they really got it right on this flight.\n",

      "             |   Punta Cana Terminal B check in was straightforward with separate Club World desks. Agent was polite, issued boarding cards, provided a voucher for the VIP lounge and explained how to find it. No fast track security unless you paid $50 per passenger but that was the airport, not BA. VIP lounge was comfortable but not quiet due to 3 crying babies but that's life! Flight boarding was on time, we were group 2 and it was well managed by gate staff Old style club world seating but the cabin was clean, cabin crew were on hand and offered champagne or orange juice, there was a bottle of water in the drawer with the White Company amenity pack. White Company duvet was clean in a sealed bag. Order for drinks was taken before take off. Drinks were served promptly followed by dinner which we ordered immediately after take off. My starter of cream of leek soup was delicious served with warm bread. I declined the main course as it was late (choice was fillet steak or shrimp linguine). Dessert was chocolate mousse or cheese and biscuits however they found both for me as I didn't have the main. Excellent pinot noir from South Africa, refills were offered. Following dinner I got about 5 hours sleep and found the lay flat bed comfortable but I am pretty small. The duvet and pillow were great. Breakfast was ho hum, no orange juice was offered, bircher muesli was fine, fruit wasn't ripe and was almost inedible. The muffin was very cold and dry, coffee okay. I declined the breakfast baguette. Excellent cabin staff and having read so many negative reviews the experience exceeded my expectations.\n",

We made a mistake and got in the Gold or Silver line (as we didnï¿½t see the sign) and when we got to the counter she scolded and berated us for being in the wrong line. She said we didnï¿½t know how to read and would not let it go even after we apologized and said we would be happy to go to the end of the other line. She continued to be discourteous toward us and made us feel like we were terrible people. This was the very worst customer service we have experienced by an airline.\n",

      "             |  LHR T5 BA Gold Wing worked well. Pleasant check in and very fast security screening. Concorde room service attentive. C gate boarding OK but nothing special for First Passengers. Latest BA version of first with only 8 suites with privacy doors. Comfortable seat with plenty of stowage. Good screen and good choice of IFE. Amenity kit good quality and bedding, pillows cushions and blankets all good. Excellent menu and food very well presented. Cabin crew could not have been more attentive and helpful without being obtrusive. On time departure and early arrival. Bags delivered relatively swiftly and priority tagged bags were first off. All in all one of the best BA First flights Iï¿½ve had in many years. Whilst not touching the Middle Eastern carriers BA First on this showing is easily the best way to cross the Atlantic.\n",

Everything you would expect of BA (and as it used to be!) Shame the same cannot be said on our recent flight back from Singapore, in Business Class on 11th Feb BA12. Miserable, unhappy and tetchy crew. Too lazy to do anything except sleep! Perhaps BA need to promote some of their short-haul performers, and let the others go.\n",

      "             |   Flight mainly let down by a disagreeable flight attendant. No queue to check in at Cape Town - good. However checkin agent was unfamiliar with BA size and weight rules for sports bags so had to wait 10 minutes while phone calls were made -- annoying. Lounge was good. Gate service was excellent with organised queues. Seat was good (the new upgraded Club Suite). The zip broke off the amenity kit so it was unusable -- BA cutting corners too much here. Offered a cocktail service which came promptly and the drink was excellent. But no nuts! So I went off to the galley to ask for some nuts or a snack to go with it. I spoke to a male flight attendant who looked at me with utter distaste that I had the temerity to ask for nuts. The he said \"where have you come from?\". What a bizarre question. I said \"seat 8E\" to which he responded with a flick of his hand - \"go ask her, she's serving you.\" I was stunned - I have not been treated that way in even the cheapest restaurants, let alone business class on a premium airline. The gentlemen concerned has no place in service or hospitality and should find a different line of work. Anyway, the food was good. The IFE worked fine. WiFi wasn't working. I managed 6.5 hours sleep and we got off the plane promptly despite being at a remote stand, requiring a bus. The luggage took quite a while to arrive. Overall 7/10. Would be 9/10 but for the rude staff member.\n",

Boarding was smooth and the seats were comfortable ï¿½ easy reline to enable dozing and sufficient pitch to get in and out. The table was firm enough to allow the use of a small laptop and mouse. A pre-flight soft drink or Prosecco was offered and both the food and drink were more than sufficient. The best part was the cabin crew ï¿½ two in PE and they were both extremely efficient, pleasant and witty. There was a good selection of movies and both the screen and the headset worked perfectly.\n",

      "             |   After the nightmare of getting through triple security at Nairobi Airport, I was looking forward to a glass of something lovely to unwind on the plane. Fat chance. An hour and a half after takeoff we were finally served a drink and meal together. I keep reading how well BA are now doing, but on both legs of this trip the crew were awful. The club suites are a great improvement but if the staff make no effort, whatï¿½s the point? On a positive note we were told my wifeï¿½s seat was broken and could not recline. I was going to swop, but at the gate they found her another. Prior to this we received an email within 30 minutes of check in with a healthy portion of Avios already added to our account. Well done customer service.\n",

      "             |   Prior to boarding a gate agent seemed to pick on elderly people and asked them to check in relatively small bags. By contrast the same staff member looked the other way to a boisterous group of 20 somethings all of whom had large amounts of luggage. London Gatwick to Marrakech with British Airways was rather disappointing. The flight is just over 3 hours and during this flight passengers in economy were offered a tiny packet of digestive biscuits. No water was offered other than a cabin crew member walking through the aisle with a bottle of mineral water and plastic cups. She claimed she ran out of water and so many passengers did not even get that miserly offering. There was no route map on this A320. The captain made only 2 very brief announcements. When I needed to use the lavatory one cabin crew member rudely drew the curtain as she was sitting behind the lavatories with one of her colleagues ï¿½ they were loudly talking about their boyfriends and ignored an elderly man who was struggling to open the small door to the lavatory. I shall add that the lavatory was unclean and had water on the floor. One concern was the seemingly casual approach to the safety demonstration. Disembarkation was not well managed either. This route is very competitive and these days one has a lot of choice. I will not use British Airways on this route.\n",

      "             |   I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied. Every time I contact them they claim they have such a huge backlog that it takes long to process them.\n",

      "             | First the good news, the club suites are such a huge improvement over the old business seats I hope I never see one again. The not so good news Iï¿½m afraid to say was the flight itself. The food has really gone downhill since my last flight, presumably this is a cost cutting measure. If other airlines can offer a really decent quality meal why canï¿½t an airline of BAï¿½s stature? Iï¿½ve always thought that a good crew can make up for all the shortcomings but not this time. The crew member looking after me could not have been more bored and was obviously just going through the motions. They couldnï¿½t even be bothered to say cheerio, and Iï¿½m not sure I would have answered if they did. Hereï¿½s hoping my return is a more satisfying experience.\n",

      "             |   I have never travelled with British airways before and this is the first time I chose to travel with BA due to the cheapest fare available during this time but I was bit unsure if I can enjoy my travel journey due to mixed reviews. I would like to express my extreme joy and satisfaction travelling with this amazing airline. I haven't seen such a great, efficient and friendly service by the cabin crew. I would like to personally thanks Ellie and Adam who were not only very professional but very kind too. Food served was delicious and the drinks were good too. I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this flight and do not hesitate to recommend to anyone to try it\n",

      "             |   London Heathrow to Male In new business class. BA continues to get its mojo back starting with a classy lounge serving innovative, and interesting, quality pre-flight food (beetroot scotch eggs?). Excellent wine (Whispering Angel). Presentation of on-board food has always been a bit hit and miss with BA, but on this occasion it was tasty and OK. Friendly and efficient on board crew. Smile, treat them respectfully, and as equals.  On time flight and early arrival.  Only awarding a 9 because we were bussed from A-C gates, otherwise a really enjoyable experience.\n",

      "             | I left for London from Johannesburg at 21:15 on 22 December 2024. My only issue with that flight was the pillows they gave us were dirty and when my 7 year old dropped some juice and I asked a cabin crew member walking past for some serviettes she told me to go to the bathroom to get some to clean it up. Those issues werenï¿½t pleasant but certainly not a major problem. I was booked on the BA0057 at 21:15 on 31 December 2024 to return to Johannesburg. The flight was delayed to the 1 January 2025 at 12:00pm. I had a connecting flight to Durban and do not live in Johannesburg. Landing in Johannesburg with 3 children at 1 am was not an option for me. BA changed my flight to 2nd January 2025 at 18:25. I requested a sooner date so I could get home sooner. I was given 1 January 2025 at 21:15. I accepted this as this is the original time I opted for and would he most convenient for me as I was doing a connection in Johannesburg to Durban. Unfortunately this flight was delayed till 2nd January at 17:00. I was extremely upset by this as I was absolutely exhausted and had 3 children who were absolutely exhausted. I also suffer from eczema and hay fever and did not have my creams and medication. This caused my eczema to flare up so badly, even my lips were cracked and burning. My allergies were so severe that my eyes were sticking together and I couldnï¿½t stop sneezing. My daughter also has eczema and has had a flare up. The staff had no sympathy or empathy for a mother traveling alone and her children. I was just told that they know itï¿½s an inconvenience and a lady even snapped at me that they trying their best. My children are 4, 7 and 11 and we were all booked on separate seats. Is that even legal let alone ethical? They were refusing to help me and saying they canï¿½t do anything. I approached 3 people, and the third person finally put us together. So they could clearly help me??? My flight from Johannesburg to Durban was originally booked on South African Airways and I paid a lot for this ticket as South African Airways is not a low cost airline. I was given a cheap low cost Airline, CemAir, which I had never even heard of, to replace my SAA flight. I suffer from flight anxiety and this is why I never book low cost airlines with tiny flights. My anxiety went through the roof on the flight! Besides all of this, I am also left with a huge credit card bill as I used up all my pounds on the 1st! I know BA is obliged to compensate me for the inconvenience under EU law but besides the compensation BA staff really needs to show more empathy for their passengers, like me, who had two hours long flight delays two days in a row and was alone with 3 children. I expect my full compensation for all of us as this has been by far the worst experience I have had traveling. All their staff kept saying is ï¿½thatï¿½s why you will get compensation.ï¿½ I am now waiting to see if I get compensated as I was promised by all of their ground staff! Legally they have to under EU law, so letï¿½s see if they put up a fight or do what is ethical and legal.\n",

      "             |   After an excellent flight on a 777 CPT to LHR the return was not as good. BA have moved the Business Class checkin from one end of the hall to the other at T5 for no apparent reason so a nice long walk to check in. Fast Track security was very slow (15 minutes). The indicator board suggested the South Lounge was \"half full\" but when I went it was uncomfortably full and it is still tatty as not refurbished, so I went to the B Pier lounge instead. Much better except as usual the staff are sort of trying to pack up early and have a bizarre way of refilling the food containers which involves actually removing them to the kitchen (which means they are gone a lot of the time) rather than replenishing them customer side. Very employee-centric behaviour. Time for the flight so down to the transit to take us to the C Gates. Except the transit had decided not to stop any more at the B Gates so we watched five maybe seven transits pass through without stopping. Eventually me and a group of maybe 15 other passengers of mixed ages decided to descend to the walkway and run all the way to the C Gates. We all arrived soaked in sweat - not a nice start to a long business class flight. The A380 is spacious but the seat is outdated now and in urgent need of replacement. IFE was not working and had to be rebooted. The headphone prong was bent so headphones not working. The USB port was not working. Drinks were brought out promptly. Starter (salmon) was delicious - truly excellent. Beef was tough ... I think a bad piece of meat rather than badly cooked. Wines were good. Cheese was average to good. Staff were friendly. Good night's sleep. Breakfast good. The recheck experience at JNB is a huge hassle - there is a giant screen saying \"Domestic recheck\" and a queue but when you get to the front of the queue you are told it is SAFAIR only and not for SAA, BA's local partner. What a hassle. Why aren't we warned or told this ... loads of BA passengers making the same mistake. Overall 5/10. It's the little things that would make this better: fast track actually fast track. Refurbish the South Lounge. Have food replenishment in the passenger area, not the kitchen; make sure the transits stop, even late in the evening; refurbish the A380s; ask Do &amp; Co (who are generally excellent by the way) to monitor meat quality rigorously.\n",

      "             |   On a recent flight from Cyprus BA621 on 23/11/24, the second the cabin door was closed the pilot announced we would be held on the runway for 2 hours. They know this prior and did not inform passengers until after we had boarded. The flight home took nearly 6 hours due to weather conditions, this plus 2 hours waiting. What did BA offer during this 8 hour hell flight, 3 oatmeal biscuits and 250ml of water for our family. When I went to the cabin crew to ask for more water, which I was told there wasnï¿½t any 3 out of the 4 cabin crew were asleep in the back row seats of the aircraft BA621 on 23/11/24. This infuriated me further as I had previously asked if there were any spare seats so that my 2 year old could spread out and get some sleep if available. I was told the flight was full. After we arrived late my connecting flight had now been missed. We then queued at the connections desk in a large queue only to watch the BA staff clock off for the night in front of us. No genuine support was given to me, or my family and we were effectively abandoned by BA. Iï¿½ve tried to speak to someone, but their helpline has an automated message saying due to the number of calls (not surprised by that aspect) they cant assist me, then hang up. Tried this several times at various times. I think itï¿½s their default message. Have raised this via their email system. Unsurprisingly been mugged off and canï¿½t escalate until 8 weeks have passed. Like I said a national disgrace.\n",

      "             |   Flight BA 0560 arrived in Rome on 11 December where ALL passengers received a SMS from BA to say that their luggage had been left in London.  My wife and I completed the required form but were in a queue for 2 hours to have it checked. BAï¿½ s agent in Rome believe the baggage would arrive on the last flight that night (10pm) and would most likely be delivered next day. Nobody from BA in Rome Airport made contact with us to explain what happened and when bags would arrive. We finally got our luggage delivered to us at 4pm on Sunday 15 December - the day before we were due to leave Rome. During the waiting period there was no contact initiated by either BA or their Rome agents and on several occasions when we called both Rome and London help desks, we received no updates. In 34 years of travelling together this has never happened before and the sheer neglect in keeping us informed is disgusting. Sadly for BA, we will never fly with it again and will share our horror story with others and strongly encourage them to fly with another airline. I would give BA an overall rating of zero.\n",

      "             |   This was the first time I flew British Airways, and it was a huge disappointment. While the seat is quite good, the food is very simple and the service is subpar. But not only that, Heathrow airport, their hub, is by far the worst large airport Iï¿½ve seen in Europe. When we landed in DC I had an email saying that my luggage stayed in London. This was last Wednesday. I have an AirTag so I could follow my suitcase. It came to Washington the following day, Thursday. Ever since, itï¿½s been sitting in the airport. British offers no means of communication: the online chat is a bot. The bot tells me to call a number in England. I did. Itï¿½s another bot. When you say you have in inquiry about luggage it sends you a link via SMS and hangs up. No option to talk to a human. In the claim form they gave me thereï¿½s a local phone, which reaches a voicemail. I keep calling them (6 times today only) and leaving messages, saying that the AirTag shows the suitcase in IAD and offering to go pick it up so they donï¿½t need to deliver it. No one replies to the voicemail. So basically I am shut out, with no luggage, no information, no customer service and no one to talk to.\n",

      "             |   Pretty good flight but still some small things that can be improved. Check in was quick. Lounge was good - tasty food and well chosen wines. Disappointingly they had not secured a gate so we had to bus to the aircraft and it was all a hot scrum. I got the last bus to avoid the crush. Emirates, Turkish, Lufthansa, Qatar all had planes on gates ... why not BA? Penny-pinching? Then it turned out the cabin crew forgot about those on the last bus so I had to ask for a welcome drink. It came and the champagne was actually cold. Well done BA ... first time they managed to serve champagne cold in my 10 years of flying with them. Big improvement. Cabin and seat were lovely as always (I greatly prefer to the Emirates white/gold bling). Drinks service was prompt. IFE was good. Starter (trout) was OK. Main (chicken) was excellent. Cheese was sold not cold (as it should be). Wines were excellent. We were not disturbed through the night so got a good sleep on a comfy bed. Cabin was a bit too warm though for my personal preference. Was woken up (as asked) and served a tasty breakfast. Small detail - as it is impossible to get water to 100C at altitude maybe BA could warm the ceramic coffee cups so coffee retains its heat a bit longer? Pouring not quite hot coffee into a nice (but cold) china mug means it is lukewarm instantly. Off the plane in record time (2 minutes) after parking. Bags were waiting for us on the belt. Excellent work by the ground staff. Overall 8/10. Improvement points: gate not bus to the plane; don't forget passengers on the last bus or who board late (but well before pushback). Standout cabin crew member was \"Miguel\" - what a star.\n",

There is only one lounge option for first class customers in Mexico City, which is the American Airlines admirals club, which is abysmal. There is a free bar, serving cheap alcohol ï¿½ an awful food selection ï¿½ and nowhere to shower. On board ï¿½ I find the seat really comfortable. The crew were fantastic, and Iï¿½m starting to really see some consistency in the quality of their first class crew. The drink selection was fine. The food was appalling. We were the victims of their new supper service. This is basically a dinner service with a lot less options/choice. No fish/seafood options on either the starters or the mains. First choice of Main unavailable as only two had been loaded. The fillet steak, so drying and overcooked, that I heard at least three people send it back. Pretty impressive for a cabin of just eight passengers..Dreadful dessert and cheeseboard. luggage off swiftly the other end ï¿½ so good to see priority tagging working.\n",

      "             | British Airways is absolute rubbish. I had to fly to Amsterdam for an urgent appointment. The flight was cancelled last minute presumably due to bad weather. They've kept us at the gate saying the plane couldn't land while literally every plane from that airport was taking off and landing with zero issues. There was another KLM flight to Amsterdam scheduled to depart at the same time. It took off on time and another KLM flight to Amsterdam later the evening also took off without any problems. It's just the one operated by British Airways was cancelled because of 'the bad weather'. Apparently, the weather was so bad that every plane could land and take off successfully apart from theirs. I had to rebook myself on the Eurostar the next day and would still miss the important appointment that I intended to go to Amsterdam for. All thanks to British Airways.\n",

      "             |ï¿½ ï¿½I'm so fraustrated. My flight was cancelled last minute, which wasn't the end of the world, even though the earliest I could get re-booked was three days later. It's the insane saga of events that proceeded to claim the compensation that I'm legally entitled to according to EU rules. Used their claims page and all was OK. It was from there that it became incomprehensibly frustrating. My case was closed but no confirmation of what the conclusion was or any money. I tried calling but kept being lead in circles; customer services can't speak to the claims team, the claims team can't be spoken to directly, customer service don't have access to the claims team's system and so on. 4 calls later and 'nothing could be done'. I had to throw my toys out of the pram on the last call and someone finally updated me. I thought that was the end; they had confirmed the claim and that I would be transferred what I was due. And then, they got the amount wrong. I wrote to they to highlight this and they said that they would rectify it. Almost 1 month since the original flight was cancelled and still haven't received what is owed to me as compensation for my wife and son. I have sent two more emails in the last two days and I've yet to get a response. It is criminal that they are not adhering to the aviation rules that dictate compensation for cancelled flights. Terrible customer service and honestly can't belive that BA are capable of such awful service.\n",

Fortunately I have a long layover so this delay does not affect me. However many others are not so lucky. While waiting we were given one small bottle of water and one tiny pack of corn kernels. Later food and drink were offered for purchase. This is my complaint. After sitting idle on this plane for nearly two hours and possibly missing connecting flights they canï¿½t give us a free bag of chips and a coke? When I asked I was told no.

      "             |  British Airways stranding my wife and I at Heathrow Airport for 2.5 days, with no access to our baggage. We we told by airline employees to purchase any necessities (toiletries, refreshments, etc.) and we'd be reimbursed. That claim was denied, with BA claiming that weather was the reason for the delay (an outright lie since every other airline in London was flying on-time). We were unable to to anything besides stand in lines for vouchers, stand in lines for shuttles, stand in line for reservations, etc. for 48+ hours. It was an absolute nightmare and I will never fly BA again.\n",

      "             |   Although like many these days, I avoid BA on long haul from London Heathrow due to my perception of poor service and lack of customer services if things go wrong, I was pleasantly surprised by my recent flight to Belfast. The aircraft actually left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The cabin crew looked bored and uninspired as they can often do on BA (I read at times) but that didnï¿½t really matter. It was a quiet flight so I say myself at the emergency exit unchallenged which was handy. Would fly again with BA where pressed.\n",

Onboard services are also archaic and outdated and the planes are the oldest out of any airline Iï¿½ve flown with. Food and service was the worst Iï¿½ve ever experienced and Iï¿½ve travelled on most airlines (Emirates, Etihad, Thai, Malaysian, Qantas, Cathay, UA etc). DO NOT FLY WITH BA.\n",

      "             |   Disappointing service, plane interior and terribly incompetent customer service I booked my flight directly through BA's website. Soon after I started to get emails saying my selected seats (I paid extra for the selection) had been changed by BA without any reason given and I was directed to the website. There I found no information on the said seat change. This happened several times (I had 4 flights altogether). The website seems to be a digital dinosaur. The first leg of my flight was fine, until I discovered in the transfer area at Heathrow that I forgot my new laptop onboard. Immediately I contacted BA's so called Customer Service (what an oxymoron), which basically said they can not do anything, I would have to wait until the cleaners (working for a contractor) would have finished their job and hope they would discover the laptop and return it to so called Lost &amp; Found at the airport. BA's customer service said they couldn't contact their colleagues in the terminal/gate were the plane was still and let them know there was a lost laptop by seat no 27A of the plane (yes I told them exactly were the laptop was). They wouldn't take any contact details either to notify me if and when the laptop would be returned and they refused to register the incident. They simply had no interest in assisting me and didn't even make an attempt to pretend they did. Communication via their online customer service was poor, and they didn't even respond to my messages. In the end I emailed the representative at Heathrow and he replied with a message form his supervisor (which did not reveal his name): \"It is not the duty of British Airways to find lost property on behalf of our passengers, however if you would like to dispute this you can contact customer relations online with further feedback.\" They took no responsibility and referred me to Smartecarte, which is the contractor cleaning their planes and apparently collecting lost items at Heathrow. I have not received the laptop, worth 2 thousand GBP, back now 3 weeks later. The flights between London and Cape Town (~12 hours), were unpleasant. The flight attendants were seemingly unenthusiastic about their job, it took up to an hour to collect the trash after the meal, which also was distributed extremely slowly. Food was not good. Boarding was slow and inefficient. Drinks were only offered twice (otherwise you'd have to ask for it especially) on this long flights. The seats were of fabric, uncomfortable and room too scarce to relax and sleep. All in all flying with British Airways was disappointing and I will not be keen on flying with them again.\n",

When we reach Iceland I emailed British Airways telling then she won't be using her return ticket and requested for a partial refund. 2 days later. I received an email from customer service that I need to contact one of their service centres via the provided link. I replied to say the link only goes to a page with various British landline phone numbers to call and explained that I am overseas then and it will not be practical to do this via international calls. They replied to say I can only do this by contacting the service centres. So the airline end up taking my money regardless.\n",

      "             |ï¿½ ï¿½I was surprised to receive confirmation pre-flight that I had 69 kgs luggage allowance. This to be later confirmed as one at 23 kg checked in, another 23 kgs carry on for under seat, and a third 23 kgs carry on for overhead stowage. Checkin opened a bit late, and the line for Executive Club members even later, but was courteous and efficient. Long queue for passport control but the fault of Brexit, not BA. My seat had no screen; no earphone socket; no charge point; no seat recline; no boarding music. All the same as low cost carriers. Captain announced \"Wonderful service from Emily and crew\" - maybe it was in Club Class, not the economy cabin. It was announced that they would serve complimentary water and snack, but only the snack came. It was also announced there would be free text messaging for Exec Club members, but I couldn't get it to work, although a member. Snacks were sold, some at twice TUI price. For example Cadbury's chocolate fingers at ï¿½3.50. I chose BA this time as when I booked it was cheaper than all the charter carriers. And being British I mustn't forget BA's impeccable safety record and normally reliable service. After landing the Purser thanked the crew for their hard work. Seems pushing one small cart down the aisle during four hours constitutes hard work in BA. But at least we were on time.\n",

      "             |   I had visa issues, and hence, was debarred from flying. The ground staff at Mumbai was excellent (a woman named Brinelle) was very helpful and understanding. I had to rebook my tickets, and while the original journey was consisting of 3 legs, BA forced me to rebook the entire ticket, because their system did not allow them to rebook just that one leg (even though there was a gap of 13 days between the two legs, not like they were connecting flights). The telephone operator was rude, took 45 minutes and kept saying she needed 3-4 more minutes to give me clarity. It was horrendous. The final price they offered me for rebooking 2 of the 3 legs was much more than the original fare for all 3 legs. She was torturous, BA was horrendous because the website does not allow you to do all this. A very poor experience, in all.\n",

      "             |ï¿½ ï¿½Singapore to Heathrow with BA. Two choices on this route A380 or 777-300. In economy and premium (and first) there isnï¿½t much in it. In club world the 777 wins as it has the suite. Check in was easy. Security and passport control in Singapore is efficient. Choice of 3 lounges (BA, Qantas or Qatar) the latter wins easily. BA lounge was ok no major negatives. Qantas wins on space. Boarding was on time. The aircraft has a high density club world cabin. Service was fine. Club suite was good. Itï¿½s the food and beverages that are being targeted I feel. The 1st meal starter was good, main of beef fillet was average, same sentiment for cheese. Wines were acceptable. Champagne choice is cheap so I did not try. Service for meals efficient given the full cabin. Breakfast was similar. The menu suggested that some might want to skip a main course and opt for starter and dessert, for this to work for BA, a major shift in how lounge options are sourced and presented would be needed. As it was I slept well, we arrived early, luggage off quickly (for once) so a reasonable flight overall. My warning to BA is that food and beverages in club world are drifting in the wrong direction\n",

      "             |   I recently travelled from Munich to London with British Airways, and it turned into an absolute nightmare. Our troubles began with their malfunctioning app. Despite checking in successfully, I was unable to retrieve our boarding passes. Upon arrival at the airport, we discovered that there were no self-service kiosks, and the check-in desks were completely unattended. After seeking help from the information desk, we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us. Her dismissive attitude was infuriating, and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in, she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance. After being put on hold for 25 minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldnï¿½t help us, we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue. By this point, our flight was delayed, and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes. When I followed up with a complaint, British Airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next timeï¿½ignoring the fact that it was the app's failure that caused all these problems in the first place! This experience cost us a staggering ï¿½682.43 in additional expenses, including new flights, hotel stays, taxi fares, and fines. Missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing. British Airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology. If their app and website are going to fail, they must provide adequate support at the airport. I will never fly with them again, and I urge others to consider alternative airlines.\n",

      "             |  I paid for seats 80 A and B on my flight from Heathrow to Boston on the A380, paying for premium economy seats. Upon arrival at the airport the ticket agent said I was not healthy enough to sit in the purchased seats due to being too old I presume (65) since there is no other reason I can find I could not sit in the exit seating. I am healthy enough to walk 10-12 miles a day and have adequate upper body strength. Attempting to convince her just got us stuck in a cattle call seat, at the rear of the aircraft, second floor and in the middle two seats of the row. We were told our money would be refunded immediately for the \"inconvenience\". After several weeks I recontacted BA and they said the complaint went to the wrong section and they were forwarding it to the next section. 6 weeks later and we still have not heard any updates except for a computer response stating most refunds were returned in 3 weeks, keep waiting. The plane then had ground difficulties and needed a quick repair. They completed that 30 minutes later and boarded the flight. The captain then came on and said it looks like they forgot to order the ground crew to back us out of the terminal and we needed to wait another 30 minutes. We were not able to make up for the lost time in the air. We landed 1.5 hours later than scheduled, wreaking havoc with our next flight.\n",

      "             |  I decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to World Traveller Plus on the return leg of our Canada holiday, paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so... only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work. I hadn't bought a book or uploaded a film because I had assumed I would be enjoying the entertainment BA had promised. So I decided to lie back and get some rest instead, only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didn't work. The flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath, but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position, forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent, when I had to keep my seatback upright, leaving me with back pain that lasted three days (I have a bad lower back). Early on in this experience I asked to be moved to economy so that I could sit normally and watch a film, but the flight was full and there was no space. The apologetic flight attendant assured me I would receive compensation, which I assumed meant the airline would, at the very least, upgrade us the next time we flew BA, since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of World Traveller Plus (the two of us only had one suitcase each, so hadn't made use of the extra baggage allowance). BA's actual compensation offer: ï¿½25 worth of Avios points each. I wrote back (since BA doesn't allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department) explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable, given the hundreds of extra pounds I'd paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver. They then ghosted me. My experience is a cautionary tale about British Airways customer support. If all goes to plan, you may well have a very pleasant World Traveller Plus experience. But if anything should go wrong, support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted. So unless you're prepared to gamble, I would advise you to either stick with Economy/World Traveller (since then you're only really paying to fly from A to B, which they do manage to do) or fly with another airline. Or you could end up like me: throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class. If your flight is to Canada, I would recommend an airline such as Air Canada, which I turned to during the uncertainty of the Covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast, no-nonsense refunds. They do cost a bit more, so when life returned to normal post-Covid, I started flying BA again, believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important. I now see that this was both a mistake and a false economy - one that has ended up costing me hundreds of wasted pounds.\n",

      "             |  The flight scheduled at 1840 left 2hours 40 minutes alter due to late arrival of incoming aircraft from Naples, as a result I missed a connection from Istanbul to Dubai, Nothing unusual. The issue acknowledged by the captain is that the plane had been late since the morning flight from Rome with rolling effect until the evening. As this was the case, whey did BA not contact me and all other passengers, I could have made other arrangements and fly early to Istanbul and not miss my connection resulting in a ï¿½300 charge and a long delay. BA has certainly lots of staff who could have informed by using the email or text. Obviously passengers are of no utility to BA once the ticket is purchased. Who can trust BA to travel? Not me now after such poor handling of a simple matter.\n",

      "             |   I have been flying BA for over 15 years. I was an American Airlines FF and gave it up for BA. I am a Gold member on BA and have been for over 10 years. Here are the things I have noticed over the last 5 years on BA. the Flight attendants are getting lazier and complacent, from cleaning bathrooms to serving meals. The food on BA has deteriorated to the point of not being able to eat the garbage they give you and having gold status is almost meaningless in the big scheme of things. I have NEVER been able to upgrade to business or first using the AVIOS points I have accumulated on a transcon flight. I fly BA now because its the only partner of American Airllines that I can easily get to europe. I have switched back to AA FF program and is already so much better. BA used to be a splendid airline and now its just another poor airline in the european market!\n",

      "             |   On arriving at Mexico Airport we were told that the flight was delayed because the aircraft had broken down and the replacement aircraft from LHR was about six hours late. When we eventually managed to check in we told that ï¿½ contrary to the BA website ï¿½ we could not have access to the 24-hour Grand Lounge Elite and instead would use the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge which would close three hours before the flight left. After that we would have to use a restaurant and were given a food voucher. Two hours before the flight was due to leave were then informed that the aircraft had diverted to Cancun because of a ï¿½volcanic ash cloud over Mexico Cityï¿½ ï¿½ although it did not appear to be affecting other flights into the airport including those from Europe. They eventually arranged taxis to take us to a hotel and we arrived at 1.30am. We were assured that we would all be on a BA flight leaving the same time the following day. The only contact after that was a local employee who stayed at the hotel. He said that he was there to organise transport and refused to give us any other contact details. (When we eventually did need transport the following day he had disappeared.) During the night, we were then sent an email telling us that we were booked onto an Air Canada flight leaving at 6.30am. This would have been impossible with such short notice and without Canadian EPA authorisation. We then spent two hours trying to make contact with BA ï¿½ its Mexico number did not work and eventually we were put on an Aeromexico flight in economy. They told us to check in as soon as we could but this meant we had to pay an extra ï¿½200 for the seats. Later, after a very long call, we were told that we could be upgraded to business with Aeromexico despite having been told earlier that there was no availability. BA then informed us that because we had already checked in ï¿½ as they had suggested ï¿½ we could not be moved and this took three more calls to Aeromexico to sort out. I totally understand that aircraft break down but the onus should be on the airline to rearrange and not the passengers. We were lucky because we took the trouble of making the calls to the UK but others ï¿½ such as a disabled lady ï¿½ had been told nothing when we left.\n",

      "             |   I have flown British Airways for many years and still do so regularly. In one of my last flights this past summer between Paris and Boston, British booked me on a connecting flight between Paris and London that gave me a maximum of 90 minutes to connect in London. London Heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take 20-30 minutes once you deplane, not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and lines at passport control and security between terminals. So already, one is pressed for time. My flight from Paris to London that day was tardy, 49 minutes tardy that day to be exact. BA Flight 323 in fact, is routinely tardy. ï¿½ donï¿½t bother with this one. Flight Connections assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that I was rushing to the gate. It was 30 minutes before my connecting flight was to depart. I ran like a fool for 25 minutes, carryons and all, arriving to the gate 5 minutes before my flight was to depart, only to be greeted by no plane. The agent said that since no one knew where I was (false) the plane left without me ï¿½ early. Gaining a few minutes was more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay. So I made the 20 minute trek back to Flight Connections knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day. I was now going to miss the wedding I was destined to attend in Boston. They sent me to a prepaid Hilton hotel room for the night but told me that I would have to pay 30 pounds each way for a taxi to take me there. They gave me a pamphlet with instructions for reimbursement. This was in early July. It took me 4 months and a complaint to the British Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of $77. There was no apology, no recognition, not even a free drink coupon for that next flight I wonï¿½t ever take with British. Like a bad insurance claim, British just kept denying my claim, expecting that I would just go away. Well, I am going away. Iï¿½m taking my $77 and using another airline for future travel.\n",

The seat was clean but as I later discovered that the foldout section would not stay up and your feet dangled over the edge when the bed was extended. After boarding was complete we were told that departure was delayed because BA had not loaded all of the cargo; we were then told that it was delayed further because there was a fault with one of the fuel pumps. It took over five hours for this problem to be corrected as the pilot later informed us that they installed new pump having initially thought that it was a software issue. During that time we were served the meal but were told that alcohol is not permitted which was curious given that we had already been served a pre-departure drink. Most of the cabin crew were male and, apparently, based in Mexico and this turned out to be a pleasant surprise given that those I spoke to were incredibly positive and friendly but seemed embarrassed at what was happening. I knew that it was the old-style seats but what was less acceptable is BAï¿½s petty penny pinching. If there was a competition for the smallest hot towel BA would be the winner. The food sounded nice and looked impressive but seemed totally tasteless.\n",

We were told on September 19 at the Heathrow Airport that our flight was cancelled and we could only have one business seat with another flight to a different airport. No one from the British Airways contacted us to apologize and to offer refund for the business class seat we lost. We filed a complaint to the British Airways and asked for reimbursement on September 21 and have not heard a word from them as of October 11, 2024. It is the worst flight experience we have ever had. Terrible customer service. Zero communication with customers. We cannot even find a phone number to call the British Airways on its website.\n",

      "             |   I recently flew from New York back to London with BA, this wasn't my first long haul with them however it was my first time travelling in World Traveler Plus. We boarded the aircraft on time and stress free and my first impression was good. The cabin was clean and the leg room was good. The recline on the seat was generous and combined with a footrest it was quite comfortable. Waiting on our seats was a decent quality cushion and blanket as well as an amenity kit. The amenity kit contained some good headphones, socks, an eye mask, lip balm, pen and toothbrush and toothpaste. Once boarding was complete we were offered a pre departure drink with orange juice, water or champagne being the options. The crew were all very friendly and professional and did their upmost to ensure that everyone was happy. Once in the air we were offered a hot towel and another round of drinks, this time with a lot more selection. Drinks were offered several times throughout the flight. A menu was also handed out not long after take off, the starter was quinoa and for main there was a choice of chicken, meatballs and pasta or a vegetarian mushroom dish. I chose the meatballs and they were really good. My only real complaint about the flight was people not getting the dish they wished for. We were sat in the last row of the premium economy cabin and by the time the meal service got to us all of the chicken dishes were gone. The moral of the story is that if you sit at the front of the cabin, you will likely get your preferred meal option. After the meal I chose to watch some shows on the well sized entertainment screen, BA is definitely up there for best inflight entertainment. Finally about an hour before landing we were served a breakfast snack, this come in the form of a warm egg and swiss cheese bagel. It was edible but also a little soggy and didn't really taste of much, I certainly wont be craving one anytime soon. We touched down into Heathrow on time before disembarking the aircraft and picking up our bags, everything was very efficient and we were on our way in no time.\n",

I am aware of the difficulties of flying with children, I know it is difficult to keep them entertained etc, I am a patient person, I have headphones. The parents of this child chose, despite a polite request, not to try and quieten their child at all. At this point one had an expectation the crew will step in. If I was singling loudly, disrupting other passengers, they would quite rightly ask me to desist. So why not speak to the parents of a child who is doing the same and disrupting the rest and sleep of other passengers? Instead, having served the meal, the crew retreated behind their curtain and left the passengers to stew. Simply not good enough. As for WiFi? Forget it...\n",

      "             | Our flight started in Seattle Wa heading to Lisbon Portugal. After a 10 hour flight and a 2 hour layover we boarded flight BA502 to Lisbon. After heading to the runway the plane stopped and the pilot said we have a small mechanical issue and a mechanic is in route. After an hour in the tarmac the flight crews announce they were going to offer complimentary WATER? Really!! Another half hour goes by and they say the flight is cancelled, no reason at that time. As we wait for a bus to remove all passengers from the plane they announce that there will be staff members back at the gate to help with meal vouchers, taxi rides and hotel accommodations. WHAT? We get off the bus and there is a line of passengers trying to figure out whatï¿½s happening. Staff hands my wife and I a $10 meal voucher and says go upstairs and someone will help you with your issues. We go upstairs and nobody knows what to do. One staff member hands us a paper for a hotel room and tells us to get your luggage and keep your receipt for the taxi to be reimbursed. Nothing else. I asked about another flight and she said they will contact you asap. Who will contact?? And she walked away. We grabbed our luggage and headed to the taxi line. As we are being driven to the hotel I receive an email for our flight the next day on a different airline, Iberian? Our assigned seats are not together?? We get to the hotel and I barely fit into the shower and a double bed. Iï¿½m 6ï¿½3ï¿½ 230lbs and with my wife. Crazy. Get a little sleep nothing to eat until the am. Another taxi ride to the airport and tried to use our meal vouchers but they were only good for the prior day. Went to the first customer service line and he didnï¿½t have the authorization to issue new vouchers. Finally after the third customer service line we had someone issue us new vouchers. Finally made it to our destination a day in half later and still had to pay for our room that we didnï¿½t even use because of the cancellation. BA refuses to reimburse us for that first night we missed. Filed a claim with BA and nothing so far. We will never fly BA again!\n",

      "             |   British Airways Flight from Edinburgh got delayed by 1 h 30 Min and there was a connecting flight part of same ticket. So I have literally run for next connecting flight of British Airways from LHR to Delhi. As a bonus trouble to my surprise when I landed in Delhi I got to know that my luggage is missing. I was assured there that my luggage will be delivered to my address but today 4th Oct I have not received it yet. They have shown my luggage at BBi air port and I have to apply leave so that I can collect it. No details point of contact, how to enter air port without ticket. All sort of trouble I have to face.\n",

      "             |   British Airways World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) product needs some improvement to justify the high cost over economy. Yes, the seat and leg room are far superior and on this flight, the crew were excellent. However, lunch/dinner was only average, wine selection was poor and like some other airlines, BA provides a revolting snack prior to landing. (The same snack is served in economy). Choice of entertainment also requires improvement. If CEO Sean Doyle is serious about elevating BA to one one of the worldï¿½s best airlines (which it once was) then work is needed to provide a better customer experience.\n",

      "             |  We flew BA between Heathrow and Berlin one way connection. Our experience with BA ground staff at Heathrow was very good, friendly and helpful at check in and baggage drop off. The crew on our flight were also very good, Captain provided some general information and welcoming in a suitable casual but efficient way. Flight stewards were also very friendly and handed out some water and small snack (chocolate bar) unexpected on a 1 hr 20 min flight. Seating was typical for class of aircraft and ticket. Cleanliness was not optimal and could be improved. From memory a slightly delayed departure from Heathrow, which was slightly reduced on arrival at Berlin. This was not an issue for us as Berlin was our destination with no connecting concerns. Our baggage arrived safely at Berlin. I understand BA has had some very negative reviews by customers but our experience on this occasion was very positive and would happily recommend and use BA.\n",

      "             |  Absolutely disgusted with BA. Our flights were cancelled on 1 May by BA even though the flight still departed. We had a connecting flight from Manchester to Heathrow which was cancelled due to weather so could not get compensation for that flight. But now it turns out we cannot get compensation for our flight to Seattle either even though BA actually cancelled it for us. I will never fly with them again.\n",

      "             | Took a trip to Nashville with my wife for a leisure break. Arrived at T5 and directed to the Club World check in zone to the left of the terminal. Zone seemed way too small for the number of passengers and the check in process was painfully slow. Queues for non premium cabins seemed to be much more effectively managed. Had a bite to eat at the departures lounge. Plenty of food options even though it was very busy. Flight departed from the furthest away satellite gate in C annex. Boarding was managed efficiently. I was in seat 4A in the Club Suites section. Lots of space and comfortable. Crew were + 40 on average and very friendly and attentive. I chose a salmon dish and was glad I was in 3A as they had run out by row 4! Entertainment was a little disappointing in terms of latest release movies. Meal prior to landing was not to my taste so I skipped it. Flight landed right on schedule so no complaints on that basis.\n",

      "             |  A nightmare journey courtesy of British Airways. Our worst flight experience in over 50 years of flying!  We were booked on BA470 scheduled to depart Heathrow at 12.05 on 5 Sept - we boarded 1.5 hrs late because despite the plane being at the gate we had to wait for a crew to arrive. Approximately 1hr into the flight the pilot advised that as the weather radar wasn't working, we would be returning to Heathrow where we circled for approx 45 mins before landing. There was no member of staff present to offer advice about an alternative flights and the customer service desk stated they would not deal with it but we had to await an email. An email finally arrived after about an hour and my husband and I were fortunate enough to be allocated seats on the 21.15 flight. This time we boarded approx 2 hrs late again the plane was at the gate but we had to wait for a crew. As a result it was around 3.00 am before we reached Venice and the long wait for taxis meant that we didn't reach out hotel beyond Mestre until 4.00 am. We've since learnt that BA have cancelled hundreds of flights over the past several days claiming 'bad weather' yet according to FlightRadar 24 no other airline flying out of Heathrow cancelled flights\n",

      "             | Absolutely atrocious. LHR-ORD-LHR Round-trip. British Airways is truly a disgrace as our \"national airline\". With only eight seats in First Class, you would think they could provide a genuine \"white glove\" experience. Instead, the crew in First Class both ways were inattentive, ill-mannered, and badly trained. One gets better service in McDonalds. BA's new First Suite is a small, uncomfortable cubicle, and miles behind premium classes at other airlines. Movie selection was very poor, and the wifi did not work properly. The amenity kit was tiny, and cheap. The airplane itself was dirty, and had clearly been cleaned in haste. The food served in First Class was grim, and especially bad on the ORD-LHR sector. The crew both sectors spent most of their time in the galley, and disappeared after the meal service. Overall, British Airways continues to decline, and one wouldn't fly them if there was an alternative. To add insult to injury, BA flies into Chicago International Terminal, and has decided that the ORD-LHR return flies out of American Airlines Terminal 3, including use of the AA dreadful Flagship Lounge at T3. Of course, nothing will change, because governments have given BA a virtual monopoly, and BA continue to have mediocre leadership that only care about costs, and their own share portfolio.\n",

      "             |   Flew with British Airways club Europe on Saturday 31st August. Poor lounge in Berlin Brandenburg airport. Emailed, to say that flight was delayed with no explanation, and no announcement made. Staff in lounge had not been told of delay, and airport info screens were not updated. Email said to keep checking online for updates. Flight took over 99 minutes late with no explanation why the late arrival of plane and departure, with a very rushed service. On arrival at LHR, quickly with passport control, then an almost hour wait for baggage to arrive on the carousels. No announcements due to the delay, meaning arriving home over 3 hours later than should of been arriving.\n",

      "             | I am beyond upset and disgusted with the disregard, lack of knowledge and lies that your company has put me through. Each call I have had with a different representative has lead to no help, nothing being resolved and false information. Due to no longer being able to fly for my original flight, I called and spoke to someone who gave me a new reference number where I could book at a later date/destination or change the name. I then had a close family member pass away suddenly to which I then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral, as I was told I could change the name. When then calling and trying to do this, I then got told that I was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the ï¿½policyï¿½. After questioning this and not wanting to get false information, I made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did. After then troubling my aunt and uncle, who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son (my cousin) for this documentation, we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name. To which we then found out was yet ANOTHER lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away (which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change.) After expressing my feelings of mistrust, that I would be taking it further as I no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company, I was told that I wasnï¿½t allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date. I then challenged the representative to speak to a manger to which I was told, they had none working, they had gone home and that no one had any direct email. After then putting in a formal complaint 5 MONTHS AGO WITH STILL NO RESPONSE. I called back to use the money to book a new flight to say I couldn't as it was a less amount (even after saying fine keep the remaining money) and I was only allowed to book the same amount or more (scam to get more money out of you). When asking to speak to a manager, shock horror, there isn't one working. When looking at the status of my complaint he said there is a back log and will get to it eventually (says a lot if the back log of complaints is longer than 5 months). To then be told there is nothing he can do. I am beyond appalled, hurt and frustrated by this whole experience and will be spreading the word and my story to every known platform and review website possible till I speak to someone who, genuinely knows what they are talking about and can come to a mutual agreement/resolve the issue as, the information I was told only leaves me to believe that this company doesnï¿½t care AT ALL about its customers and only cares about money and profit.\n",

      "             |   I purchased round trip direct flight business class ticket for my family from Hong Kong to London. A few days before the trip, the airline cancelled our return flight without giving any reasons and booked us on a flight routing via Doha which gave us 2 hour layover. On the day of departure, the flight was delayed by more than 2 hours as a result of \"crew shortage\". When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel. After the flight we reached out to make a complaint and ask for monetary consideration given the experience, the airline has not responded for more than a month. We paid up for the direct flight and premium seating, but the experience was overall very poor.\n",

Took 3+ calls for them to admit this Pakistan card wasnt mine and they sent someone else my money. After calling about 12 total times over 3 months they finally sent me half my refund  and told me they don't owe me anything.

      "             | Cargo service: that's how I felt in the A380 upper deck (supposedly nicer than the main deck for business) but packed in on the 2-3-2 configuration, head to tail as BA loves to configure its seats to make more money, I failed to enjoy business class or feel like it was worth the money. The lie-flat seats do that, as narrow as they are, and only by lowering the foot rest...the foot rest over which the person not on the aisle (I was on the aisle) has to step or crawl to get to the aisle. One can get a couple of fitful hours of sleep but only with luck. The seat controls on the A380 are primitive and antiquated. The food served was a bit better than coach but only minimally so. Well-cooked (dead) supposedly Scottish salmon. Salads with tough bits of green. If I'd paid coach+ prices for this, I'd have been sort of pleased. But business class? BA continues to hoover money out of flyers' pockets for minimal quality...and charges all but their higher grades of customers for the \"privilege\" of choosing seats in advance of 24 hr check-in. Some of their newer planes have the more traditional all-facing-forward business class....but many do not. It's really a gamble whether you'll get a pod in business or simply a lie-flat space next to many of your new-found friends...and be awakened by them. It's really time for BA to either reduce their business class prices to reflect the mediocre product or step up and re-allocate space for normal business pod seats all through their fleet.\n",

We were not allowed on our original flight because of some \"technical\" issue on their end, and had to call the airline because they could not do anything at the counter. $600 additional later, we are booked on the next flight in 12 hours. We paid for services on the original flight and asked for it to be moved, nothing happened. We had to pay for the services all over again. Next the second connecting flight, we sat on the tarmac for over two hours, then we deplaned at midnight without going anywhere! They did not even give us an hotel, we had to spend the night at the airport. They gave us a flight the enxt day, from London to Zurich, but it was three connecting flights with an hour gap each, London - Brussels - Amsterdam - Zurich, absolute nonsense! The first flight itself was delayed, so of course we missed all the other connections, and they would not pick up the phone or help us, nothing. We had zero help from BA and had to spend 10 hours at Brussels ariport sorting out and buying new tickets ourselves. We are out over $2500 at this point, with zero response from BA to reimburse us for their planning. Our final flight to India from Zurich was also delayed, we sat on the tarmac for 2 hours before the flight finally took off. costs!\n",

This is completely unacceptable, especially given the assurances I received. When I lodged a complaint, it fell on deaf ears, there has been no acknowledgment or resolution from British Airways.

      "             | An excellent flight! Despite this being a 4.5 hour flight in a A320 that is configured for short hops to Edinburgh or Glasgow, and despite there being no IFE, I ended up really enjoying the flight. I don't know if it was just that I had really low expectations, but I thought the crew were fabulous, and the food and wine was surprisingly good. The plane itself looked very new and was in perfect condition. From the very start, I really liked the crew - they were all cheerful, genuine, and clearly enjoying their work. I noticed they constantly had friendly and proactive interactions with passengers, and when the food and drink came around, they were generous with the wine - and happily provided top-ups later in the flight. The food box was deceptively small - it actually contained a decent selection of food, and was more than enough to keep me feeling satisfied on this trip. There were regular, and detailed, updates from the cockpit which I also appreciated. So whilst the hard products on this flight were limited, it was the service - and the genuine enjoyment of the crew - that won me over.\n",

      "             | I recently traveled with British Airways and had a mixed experience. Booking and Check-in: The booking process was straightforward, but our experience at the baggage counter was frustrating. While we were in line, the three employees at the counter took a 45-minute break before processing our luggage, which caused unnecessary delays. Flights: The flight to London was fine, and we enjoyed our time in the lounge during our layover, despite the delay. The connecting flight to DFW was also fine. Baggage Issues: Unfortunately, our luggage did not make it onto our flight to DFW. We arrived at DFW on Wednesday, 8/7/24, and as of 8/11/24, we still have not received our luggage. Customer Service: The most disappointing aspect has been the customer service. They have been dismissive, and no one has taken responsibility or provided a timeline for when our bags will be delivered. Overall, while the flights themselves were okay, the baggage handling and customer service has been horrible.\n",
